Fix bug:

- [ ] Fix dragging a tile causing wheel container to move when having padding. (Has something to do with @hydroperx/tiles increasing width.)

Icon issues:

- They do not show up in Next.js for some reason when building for production.

Other things:

- Change how style sheet baselines are included. (Decouple it from Container/HGroup/VGroup)
