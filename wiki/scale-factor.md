# Scale factor

This library uses the CSS `em` unit as a measurement unit influenced by the inherited `font-size` in pixels. Many numbers like gaps and padding use a printer's points unit based on `em` as well.

To alter scale for an UI section:

- Set the `font-size` CSS property to a desired value; the default being `16px`.
