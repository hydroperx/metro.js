# Live tiles

## Reset

When building live tiles, changing any of the following parameters after initialization:

- `direction`
- `dragEnabled`
- `selectionEnabled`
- `inlineGroups`
- `groupWidth`

Will cause a reset, clearing everything out, in which case the old state needs to be manually reflected.
