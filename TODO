Basic components

- [x] HGroup
- [x] VGroup
- [x] Label
- [x] Button
- [x] Circle icon button
  - [x] Arrow button
- [x] Container
- [x] ContextMenu
- [x] Select
- [x] TextInput
- [x] CheckBox
- [x] FormGroup
- [x] ProgressEllipsis (consists of horizontally moving dots)
- [ ] Tiles

## CheckBox

- [ ] Implement dragging of the carret (tried before, but failed)

## ProgressEllipsis

- [ ] Fix the little snailing at the center of the animation.

## Select

- [ ] Future change: a more Metro like transition and positioning that centers the selected option to the input button
  - [ ] "Open transition" draft: https://github.com/realhydroper/tsmetrocomponents/blob/d18900aad5e94d3429e4a762d1f79015dcf9aef4/src/components/Select.tsx#L161 (in this draft, `base_bottom =` apparently needs to be assigned something else, like `window.innerHeight - baseRect.top - baseRect.height`, to work better). (I was having a wrong assumption about what is `boundingClientRect.bottom` (it is similiar to top coordinates-wise))

## Tiles

- [ ] Do not allow dragging tiles when in selection mode
- [ ] If dragging far beyond in the orthogonal axis of the tiles container, zoom out (scale down) the entire tiles container; when not, revert back to normal scale.

## Container/HGroup

- [x] Fast horizontal scrolling as in Windows 8.1 (`wheelScrollHorizontal?: boolean`)
  - [ ] Wheel support
