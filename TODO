Use Emotion for stylizing components through a CSS class.

Basic components

- [x] HGroup
- [x] VGroup
- [x] Label
- [x] Button
- [x] Icon button
  - [x] Arrow button
- [x] Container
- [x] ContextMenu
- [x] Select
- [x] TextInput
- [x] CheckBox
- [x] FormGroup
- [x] ProgressEllipsis (consists of horizontally moving dots)
- [ ] Tiles

## CheckBox

- [ ] Implement dragging of the carret (tried before, but failed)

## ProgressEllipsis

- [ ] Fix the little snailing at the center of the animation.

## Select

- [ ] Future change: a more Metro like transition and positioning that centers the selected option to the input button
  - [ ] "Open transition" draft: https://github.com/realhydroper/tsmetrocomponents/blob/d18900aad5e94d3429e4a762d1f79015dcf9aef4/src/components/Select.tsx#L161 (in this draft, `base_bottom =` apparently needs to be assigned something else, like `window.innerHeight - baseRect.top - baseRect.height`, to work better). (I was having a wrong assumption about what is `boundingClientRect.bottom` (it is similiar to top coordinates-wise))

## Tiles

- [x] Display a simple outline for tiles (very discrete)
- [x] Support serializing and deserializing tile data
- [x] While holding click button at tile, slightly rotate X/Y according to the side.
- [x] Disabled tiles
- [ ] Drag-n-drop mode
  - [ ] Save a copy of the overall tile state in the drag start
  - [ ] Detect dragged tile over another tile using bounding client rect on both for collision check
  - [ ] Moving should shift tiles (or not if the direction to go is free).
    - [ ] If canceling shift during drag-n-drop, restore state to the initially saved one.
  - [ ] On drag end, reset cascading `inset` to `""` and call `rearrange()` after changing tile position.
  - [ ] Trigger "new group" event in TilesController so the user manually creates new groups.
  - [ ] If dragging far beyond in the orthogonal axis of the tiles container, zoom out (scale down) the entire tiles container; when not, revert back to normal scale.
- [x] Selection mode (check one or more tiles)
  - [ ] Clicking out of all tiles should uncheck all of them
- [ ] Tile content roll
  - [ ] Icon plus label contents
  - [ ] No-icon text-only contents
  - [ ] Live tile image contents
    - [ ] Bottom-attached title like in news
- [ ] Tile group
  - [ ] Right click event (or long touch holding) for the label.
  - [ ] If renameable, allow to add label to unlabeled group
  - [ ] If renameable, allow renaming label
- [ ] Dispatch context menu event in a tile on a long touch pressure (call exactly `on_context_menu`, not directly the user's context menu, since the library auto checks/unchecks for the user)
- [x] Open transition
- [x] Hide transition
- In `rearrange`:
  - [ ] Fix group label not showing up (width = 0, why?)
- [ ] Fast easy scrolling based in Windows 8.1
