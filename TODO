Basic components

- [x] HGroup
- [x] VGroup
- [x] Label
- [x] Button
- [x] Icon button
  - [x] Arrow button
- [x] Container
- [x] ContextMenu
  - [ ] Allow scrolling the context menu (`scroll?: boolean`)
- [ ] Select
  - [ ] Update for initial value (+ update valueHyperText)
  - [ ] On selection, update valueHyperText
  - [ ] Handle disabled
  - [ ] `big?: boolean`: If `true`, displays a big elegant select list (only the main button changes).
    - [ ] In this case, open transition must be simplified and select list goes always below the button
  - [ ] Scroll (display arrows smartly based in scroll events; at a certain amount of items the list is scrollable)
  - [ ] RTL support
  - [ ] Transition
    - [ ] Trick: items have horizontal border, and the list has vertical borders.
    - [ ] Trick: during transition items are fixed and positioned manually; however, after transition, they are normally positioned (allowing for scroll), with the input position centering the selected option after open.
    - [ ] Open transition (start with all items invisible and expand them centering the current selected option to the input)
      - [ ] z-index of selected item is the maximum
    - [ ] Close transition (push the last selected option towards the input)
      - [ ] z-index of selected item is the maximum
- [ ] TextInput
  - [ ] Bordered when the provided theme's `colors.background` is a near or equal color to `color.inputBackground`
