Use Emotion for stylizing components through a CSS class.

Basic components

- [x] HGroup
- [x] VGroup
- [x] Label
- [x] Button
- [x] Circle icon button
  - [x] Arrow button
- [x] Container
- [x] ContextMenu
- [x] Select
- [x] TextInput
- [x] CheckBox
- [x] FormGroup
- [x] ProgressEllipsis (consists of horizontally moving dots)
- [ ] Tiles

## CheckBox

- [ ] Implement dragging of the carret (tried before, but failed)

## ProgressEllipsis

- [ ] Fix the little snailing at the center of the animation.

## Select

- [ ] Future change: a more Metro like transition and positioning that centers the selected option to the input button
  - [ ] "Open transition" draft: https://github.com/realhydroper/tsmetrocomponents/blob/d18900aad5e94d3429e4a762d1f79015dcf9aef4/src/components/Select.tsx#L161 (in this draft, `base_bottom =` apparently needs to be assigned something else, like `window.innerHeight - baseRect.top - baseRect.height`, to work better). (I was having a wrong assumption about what is `boundingClientRect.bottom` (it is similiar to top coordinates-wise))

## Tiles

Fix bug:

- [ ] Somewhat if you keep snapping tiles around, at some point some of them may not snap at some places temporarily. Debugging: this bug is **not** about "tile data" (x, y, w, h) duplicating themselves.

Other notes:

- [ ] Controller
  - [ ] Rename group
- [ ] Events
  - [ ] `click` (tile)
- [ ] Click in a group label should make the label editable (pressing enter should accept the change, and escape should cancel it). It then turns ineditable once pointer is down outside.
- [ ] Ctrl+A selects all tiles
  - [ ] Trigger the `options.checkedChange` event
- [x] Checking tiles
  - [ ] Dispatch context menu event in a tile on a long touch pressure (call exactly `tile_onContextMenu`, not directly the user's context menu, since the library auto checks/unchecks for the user)
- [ ] Enter selection mode (when checking tiles)
- [ ] Exit selection mode
- [ ] Clicking out of all tiles should uncheck them and exit selection mode
  - [ ] Trigger the `options.checkedChange` event
- [ ] Fast scrolling as in Windows 8.1

More notes:

- [ ] If dragging far beyond in the orthogonal axis of the tiles container, zoom out (scale down) the entire tiles container; when not, revert back to normal scale.
- [ ] Clicking out of all tiles should exit drag-n-drop mode (useful in case a tile is deleted while being dragged)
