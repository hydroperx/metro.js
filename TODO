Use Emotion for stylizing components through a CSS class.

- https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction

Basic components

- [x] HGroup
- [x] VGroup
- [x] Label
- [x] Button
- [x] Circle icon button
  - [x] Arrow button
- [x] Container
- [x] ContextMenu
- [x] Select
- [x] TextInput
- [x] CheckBox
- [x] FormGroup
- [x] ProgressEllipsis (consists of horizontally moving dots)
- [ ] Tiles

## CheckBox

- [ ] Implement dragging of the carret (tried before, but failed)

## ProgressEllipsis

- [ ] Fix the little snailing at the center of the animation.

## Select

- [ ] Future change: a more Metro like transition and positioning that centers the selected option to the input button
  - [ ] "Open transition" draft: https://github.com/realhydroper/tsmetrocomponents/blob/d18900aad5e94d3429e4a762d1f79015dcf9aef4/src/components/Select.tsx#L161 (in this draft, `base_bottom =` apparently needs to be assigned something else, like `window.innerHeight - baseRect.top - baseRect.height`, to work better). (I was having a wrong assumption about what is `boundingClientRect.bottom` (it is similiar to top coordinates-wise))

## Tiles

New tile grids implementation:

- [ ] Controller
  - [x] Add tile
  - [ ] Get tile hypertext elements (returns the button)
  - [ ] Remove tile
  - [ ] Set tile size (involves use of `tiles_state` and `load`, and will also alter the `data-size` attr and the `tiles` map)
  - [ ] Set tile color (should update `tiles`, `tile_btn.style.background` and `data-color`)
  - [ ] Set tile label
  - [ ] Set tile icon
  - [ ] Set tile hypertext
  - [ ] Resize tile
  - [x] Add group
  - [x] Remove group (simply call `remove_group`)
  - [ ] Rename group
- [ ] Events
  - [ ] `check` (tile)
  - [ ] `click` (tile)
  - [ ] `contextMenu` (tile)
    - [ ] Long touch pressure
- [ ] Context menu (or long touch hold) in a group label should open a context menu allowing to rename the group.
- [ ] Ctrl+A selects all tiles
- [x] Handle drag start and drag move to detect drag change and determine whether to reset tilt 3D transformation.
- [ ] Maximize group length orthogonal to the direction
- [x] Handle tile color
- [ ] Tile content
  - [ ] Icon
  - [ ] Label
  - [ ] Live tiles (and rolling)
- [x] Checking tiles
  - [ ] Dispatch context menu event in a tile on a long touch pressure (call exactly `tile_onContextMenu`, not directly the user's context menu, since the library auto checks/unchecks for the user)
- [ ] Enter selection mode (when checking tiles)
- [ ] Exit selection mode
- [ ] Clicking out of all tiles should uncheck them and exit selection mode
- [ ] Fast scrolling as in Windows 8.1

More notes:

- [ ] If dragging far beyond in the orthogonal axis of the tiles container, zoom out (scale down) the entire tiles container; when not, revert back to normal scale.
- [ ] Clicking out of all tiles should exit drag-n-drop mode (useful in case a tile is deleted while being dragged)
- [x] Selection mode (check one or more tiles)
  - [ ] Clicking out of all tiles should uncheck all of them
- [ ] Tile content roll
  - [ ] Icon plus label contents
  - [ ] No-icon text-only contents
  - [ ] Live tile image contents
    - [ ] Bottom-attached title like in news
- [ ] Fast easy scrolling based in Windows 8.1 (implement that in another component, like Container, HGroup and VGroup)
