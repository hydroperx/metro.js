Use Emotion for stylizing components through a CSS class.

Basic components

- [x] HGroup
- [x] VGroup
- [x] Label
- [x] Button
- [x] Circle icon button
  - [x] Arrow button
- [x] Container
- [x] ContextMenu
- [x] ComboBox
- [x] TextInput
- [x] CheckBox
- [x] FormGroup
- [x] ProgressEllipsis (consists of horizontally moving dots)
- [ ] Tiles

## CheckBox

- [ ] Implement dragging of the carret (tried before, but failed)

## ProgressEllipsis

- [ ] Fix the little snailing at the center of the animation.

## ComboBox

- [ ] Future change: a more Metro like transition and positioning that centers the selected option to the input button
  - [ ] "Open transition" draft: https://github.com/hydroperx/metro/blob/d18900aad5e94d3429e4a762d1f79015dcf9aef4/src/components/ComboBox.tsx#L161 (in this draft, `base_bottom =` apparently needs to be assigned something else, like `window.innerHeight - baseRect.top - baseRect.height`, to work better). (I was having a wrong assumption about what is `boundingClientRect.bottom` (it is similiar to top coordinates-wise))

## Tiles

- [ ] Do not allow dragging tiles when in selection mode
- [ ] If dragging far beyond in the orthogonal axis of the tiles container, zoom out (scale down) the entire tiles container; when not, revert back to normal scale.

# Other random notes

- [ ] PreferPrimary affects the loading icon and loading linear dots
- [ ] ComboBox
  - [x] ComboBox should be ComboBox
  - [x] ComboBoxOption should be abbreviated to Option
  - [ ] Change how ComboBox pops up, implementing the previously postponed transition
- [ ] Checkbox
  - [ ] Checkbox indicator should be draggable (depends on RTL)
- [ ] ContextMenu
  - [ ] Fix context menu not showing down scroll indicator on viewport overflow
- [ ] Item
- [ ] Reimplement live tiles
  - [ ] API for live pages should change a bit (e.g. icon may be placed on a certain place and be resized, and label may be configured black or white)
